		   !!! WARNING !!!

The "2x scaling" fullscreen mode does not
work on the windows version, and will make
the game hang! If you accidentaly activate
it, go into taskmanager and kill the
umg.exe process. You will have to use the
keyboard, as the mouse stays locked until
you kill the process. Then open the
config.cfg file in the data directory,
look for the "FULLSCREEN 1" line and change
it to "FULLSCREEN 0". Save and restart the
game.

The 1x and 4x fullscreen modes work fine!

Also, while the game is running, the mouse
is locked to the upper left corner of your
screen, even if you alt-tab out of it.
Exit the game to unlock it.

These bugs will be fixed in future
versions, but our windows coder is away
for a few days.

Remember, its a beta. :)
