textTutorialSign01 Welcome to Unnamed Monkey Game! Follow the Hint Signs for further instructions.
textTutorialSign02 The game depends highly on jumping on platforms. Try to practice on that set of platforms on the left.
textTutorialSign03 The platforms are one-way only. You Can't jump down through them.
textTutorialSign04 Jump up and touch the wall, then press [jump] + [left] to bounce off the wall. It's called "wall-jumping".
textTutorialSign05 You can do multiple wall-jumps in a row. Give it a try.
textTutorialSign06 You can swim in the water. Your movement will be slowed down.
textTutorialSign07 The seaweeds can hurt you. Avoid them. Also watch out for that fish!
textTutorialSign08 You can knock-off enemies by stomping on them. Pick them up and use as projectiles against other enemies.
textTutorialSign09 Some enemies cannot be stomped on. Kill this one by throwing other enemies at it.
textTutorialSign10 You need to find a key to unlock this door.
textTutorialSign11 Spikes can hurt you. Try to jump over them.
textTutorialSign12 Collect hearts to regenerate your health.
textTutorialSign13 You've found a key. Now go open that door!
