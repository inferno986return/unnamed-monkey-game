Archive (and maybe one day a port) of the Unnamed Monkey Game by zear, that was famously on the GCW Zero

*Unnamed Monkey Game* is a homebrew platformer which plays homage to the original Gameboy with its choice of graphics and music.

The game was developed into a demo though presumably remains unfinished, along with the website being down due to a MySQL error - makes me wonder if it will be completed.

I've archived the installer from scene.org and the .opk file from the GCW Zero website which can be played on a GCW Zero console (and possibly other Dingoo consoles).

I would like to see this game completed or possibly remade. Perhaps it could be a Godot project?

## Original description

*Unnamed Monkey Game* is a 2d platformer - and just that. 

Instead of stunning graphics and "innovative" gameplay, we decided to go for the tried and tested. Ultra-low-end graphics, but with lovingly drawn sprites and well  designed levels. Gameplay  mechanics that are hardcoded into the brain of every child of the  80s. Focusing on the detail instead of trying to revolutionize the world of video games.

This is an early preview version, later versions will include many more levels, a full fledged editor, an old-school soundtrack, and much more...  

The game is fully portable, and already runs on:  
PC Linux/Mac/Windows, Dingoo A320, GP2X, Wiz, Caanoo, OpenPandora and SEGA Dreamcast. 
Other platforms will follow!  

UMG is written in C and using SDL.  

Released at TUM 2011 in Karlsruhe
